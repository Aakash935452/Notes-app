# Notes-app
â€¢ Developed a comprehensive notes application using the MERN stack, featuring a smooth and adaptable
interface for users to create, edit, and organize notes. Utilized React JS, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for frontend
development, while Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB were used for backend operations. Key features
include user authentication, JWT real-time note editing, and responsive design. The application has
significantly enhanced the user experience and backend efficiency
